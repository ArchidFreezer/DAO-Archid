# DAO-Archid
Dragon Age: Origins Mod

## Overview
This repository contains the contents of the my Dragon Age: Origins mod named archid.

The mods installed are strongly based on the list from [Sintar Gaming](https://www.sinitargaming.com/dao.html).
I have done away with all dazip installs, instead I extract the dazip contents into loose files and add the strings into the mod string table. In many cases I also rename some of the files so that there is a consistency of filenames to make the mod organisation easier.

I do not include all the mods from the guide and add some additional ones that I like, but the core of my installation is from the website. The list of [included mods](docs/included_mods.md) shows all the mods that I have installed, plus the author and URL where they were sourced from for accreditation.

Large Files - Due to the GitHub limitation on file sizes in free repositories it is not possible for some mods to be commit and pushed, these are included in my mod, but not in git. The list of [included mods](docs/included_mods.md) indicates any that are impacted by this.

## Structure
The repository has 4 main sections:

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| addin | This is the folder generated by the toolset for any new module that contains the contents of the `addins\archid` folder. The only files that are expected to be in here are the `*.cif` and `*.tlk` files. |
| docs | Documentation for the project, this is both GitHub markdown and other documentation |
| [package_override](docs/package_override.md) | Contents that should go in the `packages\core\override` folder and contains the vast majority of the mod files |
| source | Contains source files that are used to generate the game files. These are typically spreadsheets for the `gda` and `tlk` files |

## Usage
The preferred method for deploying this repository in game is through the use of symbolic links, or junctions, to include the repository folders into the correct game location.

There are 2 folders that need to be included: `addin` and `packages_override` which need to be linked to the `\%userprofile%\Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age` folder in the user documents folder.
For Windows the following commands should be run from an Admin command prompt:

```bat
cd "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\packages\core\"
mklink /j override <git_dir\package_override>

cd "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\addins\"
mklink /j af_archid <git_dir\addin>
```

You then need to tell the game about the mod, which is done by adding the following into your `\%userprofile%\Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\Settings\addins.xml` file

```xml
  <AddInItem UID="af_archid" Name="Archid">
    <Title DefaultText="Archid" />
    <Description DefaultText="Archid mod that is a collection of multiple other mods merged together, plus additional custom content." />
    <URL DefaultText="https://github.com/ArchidFreezer/DAO-Archid" />
    <Version>0.1</Version>
    <Publisher DefaultText="Archid" />
  </AddInItem>
```
