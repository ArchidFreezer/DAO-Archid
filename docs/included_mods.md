# Included Mods
The following mods were included, either in full or in part, in the archid mod. In order to simplify the archid mod structure some included mods have had their files renamed and moved. Some of these mods have had their source code merged into shared files, in some cases for simplicity and in others because there would be conflicting code otherwise.

For mods where there are alternatives that provide similar functionality and one provides the source code and another doesn't I will favour the one with source as this keeps things simpler and helps reduce potential conflicts later.
